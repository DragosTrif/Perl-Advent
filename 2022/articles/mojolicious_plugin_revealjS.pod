Santa's elf had a problem. He had to write very fast a presentation and show it to a bunch of new elf's. The email assigning this to him was sent my Santa himself.
The elf started to look on Metacpan and found this module: 'Mojolicious::Plugin::RevealJS'. He quickly typed the following commands:

    cpanm Mojolicius Mojolicious::Plugin::RevealJS

Now he could generate an mojo lite app using:

    mojo generate lite-app slide_show
